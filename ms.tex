\section{Introduction}

Numerous radio telescopes are now exploring the prospects for using
measurements of highly redshifted 21cm emission to inform our understanding of
cosmic reionization in the redshift range $6< z<12$, corresponding to radio
frequencies below 200 MHz (see reviews in
\citealt{Furlanetto:2006p2267,Morales:2010p8093,Pritchard:2012p9555}).  These
include telescopes aiming to measure the global temperature change of 21cm
emission during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), such as the Compact
Reionization Experiment (CoRE) and the Experiment to Detect the Global EoR
Signature (EDGES; \citealt{Bowman:2010p8546}), and interferometers aiming to
measure the power spectrum of 21-cm EoR emission, such as the Giant Metre-wave
Radio Telescope (GMRT;
\citealt{Paciga:2011p9470,Paciga:2013p9627})\footnote{\url{http://gmrt.ncra.tifr.res.in/}},
the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR;
\citealt{Yatawatta:2013p9699})\footnote{\url{http://www.lofar.org/}}, the
Murchison Widefield Array (MWA;  \citealt{Bowman:2012p9138};
\citealt{Tingay:2013p9022}))\footnote{\url{http://www.mwatelescope.org/}}, and
the Donald C. Backer Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization
(PAPER; \citealt{Parsons:2010p6757,Parsons2013b})\footnote{\url{http://eor.berkeley.edu/}}.

As such, there has been a renewed interest in the spectral and spatial variation of
foreground emission in the 100--200 MHz frequency band that covers
the $z=6$--13 redshift range expected to encompass reionization
\citep{furlanetto_et_al2006}.
In particular, the spectral properties of extra-galactic point-sources are important
both because they are valuable calibration references
and because they are strong foreground emitters that must be removed from 21-cm EoR measurements.
With the sparse availability of measured foreground properties in the
100--200-MHz frequency band over large areas of the sky \citep{deolivieracosta_et_al2008}, continued
foreground characterization is a
vital step en route to any 21-cm EoR detection.
At these low
frequencies the Southern sky is much less well known than the North, 
with catalog source fluxes at 150MHz being inaccurate at the 20\% level
for $\delta<-20$\arcdeg (XXX cite).
Both PAPER and the MWA are located in the southern hemisphere at radio-quiet
reserves being prepared for the upcoming Square Kilometer Array, and hence,
the
most extensive surveying work is now being conducted by the EoR experiments
themselves \citep{Jacobs:2011p8438,Williams:2012p8768}.

One significant complication to improving the state of affairs in foreground characterization
is that many 21cm EoR experiments, including LOFAR in the northern hemisphere, and
PAPER and MWA in the southern hemisphere, are designed for drift-scan observations.
This design decision has largely been driven by the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of
phased and/or correlated dipoles for achieving the aggressive sensitivity requirements
for measuring the 21cm power spectrum of reionization (XXX cite).
Adding to the challenge, these telescopes 
cover much wider fields of view ($>10$\arcdeg) and bandwidths
($\sim 100$\% fractional) than traditional dish telescopes.
Because they do not physically point, flux calibration for such arrays relies heavily
on an accurate model of the primary beam response to correct for an
the apparent flux scale that varies across the sky.
This direction dependent gain is currently uncertain to 10\% or higher
% XXX 20% seems a bit grim.  Doesn't jonnie argue for 5 to 10% in his paper?
%XXX 20\% comes from the overall uncertainty between MWA and PAPER, part of which is also side lobes. 
%	Jonnie's fluxes are dominated by the side lobes in the pgb16 data, the fluxes have a range of errors around 15 to 20%
\citep{Pober:2012p8800}, and comprises a large fraction of the 20\% difference between current telescopes \citep{Jacobs:2013p9713}.

In this paper, we set out to significantly improve the accuracy of spectral measurements between 
100--200 MHz for a set of bright sources in the declination range XXX to XXX that
are of particular value for southern-hemisphere 21cm EoR experiments such as PAPER and the MWA.
Using the fact that, for this restricted declination range,
sources transit through a nearly identical primary beam response pattern, we are able to avoid one of the
most debilitating source of error in these measurements: the primary beam.  
% XXX update document map
In \S\ref{sec:analysis} we describe our approach for measuring source spectra with
drift-scan observations and deriving an absolute flux scale from catalog data.  
In \S\ref{sec:Observations} we detail the instrumental 
setup, observations and analysis method followed. In \S\ref{sec:fits} we
compare the spectra with available data.  We conclude in 
\S\ref{sec:Conclusion}.


%The ideal solution is to use a wide-grid of
%well-known calibrators to map the primary beam and set the flux scale.  
% XXX don't go to "ideal solution" just yet
% XXX ARP: add importance of accurate flux vs. frequency (Parsons et al. 2012, etc.)

%The position dependent gain varies for each instrument.   LOFAR and MWA have a range of electrically steerable beams each with a different shape. For MWA and LOFAR, the number of high quality calibration sources is more important.  PAPER has a single broad, 45\arcdeg wide, primary beam; sources at nearby declinations sample the same primary beam many times.
% This will in turn provide a wide base to assess the accuracy of the primary calibrator which sets the overall amplitude of the EoR power spectrum.  

\section{Background}

% XXX unsure about this section.  need someplace to give overviews of catalogs

Historically, the best
EoR band data were by \citet{Slee:1995p7541} with Culgoora Circular
Array\footnote{Known during daylight hours as Culgoora Radio Heliograph} and
various higher frequency measurements with Parkes.  These data are typically
uncertain to 20\% or higher and provide little coverage of the EoR band beyond
a single narrow-band data point. 

More recent surveys include narrow-band surveys by the GMRT and Mauritius, a
deep survey of the region near Hydra A by the 32 antenna MWA prototype
\cite{Williams:2012p8768} and a wide field survey by PAPER, also with 32
elements \cite{Jacobs:2011p8438}. Several sub-channels were provided in the
Williams catalog, though with 60-80\% error bars ---large compared to the 30\%
uncertainty on their wide band measurements.  The latter cover the band and
spatial scales relevant to EoR measurements but are limited by the accuracy of
the primary beam \citep{Jacobs:2013p9713}.

A method for decoupling uncertain fluxes from the uncertain beam has been
described by \citet{Pober:2012p8800}. In simulation the method was able to
achieve 3 to 10\% accuracy in measuring the primary beam, depending on the
number of antennae and other variables. The Pober method emphasized the need
for many repeated measurements of each alt-az pointing. Further investigation
is under way to improve and implement this method and would be greatly aided by
the availability of precise flux measurements unaffected by primary beam
uncertainty. 

This paper reports a set of flux measurements where a primary beam
model has not been used to estimate the flux, but instead are directly
calibrated to a single calibrator making the track through the beam.

% XXX elaborate on:
%However, catalog source fluxes at 150MHz are also inaccurate to the 20\% level,
%particularly at southern declinations ($\delta<-20$\arcdeg). 
% not sure where this went. -dcj

% XXX remove PAPER specificity from below?
EoR measurements in the southern sky have focused on the coldest regions where
galactic foregrounds are minimal. With the majority of possible observing time falling on 
RA=4h,Dec=-30. The brightest and least-resolved calibrator in this region is Pictor A 
(5h19m49.1 -45d46m45.0). Pictor A is a nearby FR-II type radio galaxy 
 similar to Cygnus A.  At $\sim$400Jy Pictor is bright and sufficiently distant from other 
bright sources to make it eminently suitable as both a phase and flux calibrator. Its apparent
size of $\sim$8\arcmin is smaller than the scales being probed by current EoR instruments , 
making resolution effects, making it suitable for precision calibration.  However, 
like most other sources, precise flux measurements in the EoR band are not available.
The current best EoR band measurement
is uncertain to 12\% and appears to imply spectral flattening in the EoR band
\citep{Perley:1997p9312}.

Establishing an accurate spectrum for Pictor A is of particular importance for
PAPER --- a dedicated EoR experiment 
that employs drift-scanning, dual-polarization dipole antennas 
tuned for efficient operation over a 120--170-MHz band.  PAPER is located in the South African Karoo desert
on the Square Kilometer Array
South Africa (SKA-SA) reserve, 100km north of the small town of Carnarvon.
The PAPER array has grown from 16 elements deployed in early 2009 to a
64-element imaging array in 2011 (see Figure \ref{fig:antpos}). 
Since November 2011 it has been arranged in a maximally redundant grid 
configuration to make deep power spectral integrations \citep{Parsons:2012a}.
Though highly sensitive as a power spectrum instrument, the maximally redundant
has a broad point spread function and is able to measure only the brightest sources,
like Pictor A, for flux calibration purposes.

\section{Approach}

% XXX incorporate
Given the large uncertainties in the literature, and the necessity for PAPER power-spectrum analysis
to use Pictor A for flux calibration, we felt it prudent to examine Pictor A directly.
In this section, we describe how we use PAPER in its imaging configuration
to measure Pictor A and a selection of known, bright sources in a 5\arcdeg strip centered
on -45\arcdeg. % XXX  

As we've seen above, any one point in the primary beam might be uncertain to 10\% or more. However
this is partially a function of the imaging mode. In \citet{Jacobs:2013p9837} several limitations were identified that
exasperated the primary beam uncertainty.  First, in imaging each source flux is measured at just a few 
points in the primary beam. As errors tend to vary across the beam, the uncertainty will tend to vary between sources.
Here we have averaged over all possible positions making the uncertainty a function of the net uncertainty in the beam,
and stabilizing the source-to-source variations in error bars. The second limitation identified also identified in \citet{Williams:2012p8768}
was the increase of uncertainty towards the edge of the beam. To minimize our sensitivity to both beam and noise
uncertainty, we weight the source track by an additional factor of the primary beam model. 

Algebraically, the apparent flux at alittude-azimuth position $\theta-\phi$,
 is the true flux multiplied by the actual primary beam

\[
S_\textrm{apparent}(\theta,\phi) = B_A(\theta,\phi)  S
\]

Integrating over the full source track and weighting by our model primary beam, we estimate the spectrum

\begin{align}
S_\textrm{estimate} &=& \sum_t   \frac{\sum_\phi B_M(\theta,\phi) S_\textrm{apparent}(\theta,\phi) }{ \sum_\phi B^2_M(\theta,\phi)}
S_\texrm{estimate} & =&  \frac{\sum_\phi B_M(\theta,\phi) B_A(\theta,\phi)}{ \sum_\phi B^2_M(\theta,\phi)} S
\end{align}
In the fully general case, an incompletely sampled track will have its own unique weight. In this case, where each track is fully sampled,
 the only remaining independent variable is the source declination.
\[
g(\delta) = \frac{\sum_\phi B_M(\theta,\phi) B_A(\theta,\phi)}{ \sum_\phi B^2_M(\theta,\phi)}
\label{eq:g}
\]

\label{default}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
 We may simulate this integral by calculating $g$ for 
similar, but not identical models. For example, consider the case where the true beam is the model beam 
but rotated by 90 degrees ('y' instead of 'x').  As shown in Figure \ref{XXX}
 tracks separated by 10\arcdeg declination differ by as much as 25\%. 
However, looking at the weighted tracks, the portion inside the sum in Eq \ref{eq:g} (Figure \ref{fig:beam_track_sim}), 
we see that  we see that over a good portion of the beam, these tracks are very similar.  Thus
  the sum displays very little declination dependance (Figure \ref{XXX}), varying by a maximum of 0.7\% over 
  the declination range -30 to -60. 
   However this conclusion is limited by the accuracy of the simulation. To limit our susceptibility to possibly larger errors we limit our use of this
  technique to with $\pm5$\arcdeg of Pictor A.
  
Another implication of this simulation is that there will be a net bandpass common to each source. 
We estimate this bandpass by nominating one source as a bandpass calibrator, dividing its integrated spectrum by a 
spectral model, and applying these calibration coefficients to the rest of the sources. Note that this  
only puts the measurements on a common flux scale within the PAPER band given the flux model
chosen for the calibrator.  A flux scale extrapolated from many catalog values is calculated separately in \S \ref{sec:flux_scale}.




%This limitation in declination allows us to use a single source to calibrate all the measurements without 
%needing to transfer gain solutions across the sky using a beam model. By insisting that the tracks of all sources
% overlap entirely with a common calibrator we are able to directly calibrate out the effective passband of
% the primary beam. 
%This allows us to make a more precise flux measurement that provides a reference standard for future work.


We choose sources from the Molonglo
Reference Catalog \cite[MRC]{Large:1981p7798} that are within 5\arcdeg in
declination of a common calibrator (J2331-416) and have a flux extrapolated
from 408MHz greater than 10Jy assuming a power law spectral index of
-1.\footnote{Most radio sources in this band have power law spectra $S(\nu) =
\left(\frac{\nu}{\nu_0}\right)^\alpha$. } This selection contains 62 sources in a narrow
stripe that passes through the majority of the southern EoR fields, much of the
galaxy and Centaurus A. This stripe in the broader context of the galactic plane
is shown in Figure \ref{fig:error_map}.
A list of these 
sources is given in Table \ref{tab:src_spec}. 

For these sources, spectral data measured below 2 GHz were compiled from 
the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED)
\footnote{\url{http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/}}. Cross-matching radio sources
between bands is made difficult by changes in resolution, spectral curvature,
and resolved multi-scale structure.  For a small number of sources these
problems can be ameliorated by inspection of the spectra, source names,
coordinates,  and originating publications. However for a large sample of
sources this becomes unwieldily and prone to error. Thus for the larger number
of samples we make use of the Vollmer et al meta-catalog which takes pains to
match multi-wavelength observations \citep{Vollmer:2010p6422}.
% given the known source dimensions and spectral properties as well as telescope bandwidth and spatial resolutions. 

The spectra reported here are measured by beam-forming, phasing the visibilities to
the target location, and summing to produce a dynamic spectrum. The spectrum is then isolated
from neighboring sources by filtering and averaged in the time domain.  Though we do not rely on
the primary beam model to estimate flux, we do employ it here to down weight low SNR measurements.
Each source track is paired with samples of a calibrator to build a calibrator spectrum with the same weighting
and the same track through the primary beam.  This calibrator observation provides a spectral bandpass unique 
to that particular cut through the beam.
The expectation is that, since all sources at similar declinations follow similar tracks 
through the PAPER beam, any errors present in the original measured spectra as a result of differences between
the simulated and actual beam response should be absent in the ratio between source spectra, and therefore
should be corrected by the applied gain factor.


To derive a source spectrum from each drift-scan source profile, we compute a weighted average using
weights derived from a model of
PAPER's primary beam response as an effective approximation of inverse-variance weighting
\citep{pober_et_al2012}, and averaging over the time series for each source.  Each output source spectrum
represents a best estimate given the limitations of the beam model and flux calibration that were established
up to this point, according to the equation:
% XXX equation for time-dependent beam amplitude times source flux for perceived flux density
To further improve these estimates, we derive an additional frequency-dependent gain parameter,
smoothed on 10-MHz scales,
that brings the spectrum of J2331-416 into closest agreement with a power-law spectrum
that represents the best fit to measurements below 1 GHz.
This additional gain factor was applied to all measured spectra, including that
of Pictor A.  

Finally,
an absolute flux scale is set
by Monte Carlo fitting to a subset of sources, all of which are calibrated to
the Baars et al scale.

\subsection{Observations}

 Measurements are derived from observations using  the east-west dipole arms of
64 PAPER antennas deployed in a minimum-redundancy imaging configuration
(see Figure \ref{fig:antpos})
at the Karoo Radio Observatory site in South Africa.
A 100-MHz band from 100-200MHz was correlated
with 2048 frequency channels and integrated for 10.7 seconds before
visibilities were stored.  Observations included here on  July 4, 2011, running
from JD2455748.17 to JD2455748.72. and October 17, 2011 running from
JD2455852.2 to JD2455852.6.  In both seasons two antennas were omitted owing to
malfunctioning signal path. This 20 hour long combined dataset provides
observations provides complete hour angle coverage for the entire 24 hours of
Right Ascension. The July portion of the dataset comes from the same observing
campaign described by \cite{Pober:2013p9567} and \cite{Stefan:2012p9707}. 
%July (\#40,\#55), September (\#7,\#28) 

%COMPRESSION
\subsection{Data Compression}

In pre-processing, we use delay/delay-rate (DDR) filters
\citep{Parsons:2009p7859} to identify radio-frequency interference (RFI)
events, and as part of a data compression technique that reduces data volume by
over a factor of 40.  A more detailed description may be found in Appendix A of
\cite{Parsons2013b}, which uses the same compression method on PAPER power
spectrum observations. Here we summarize the process.

First, we remove known RFI transmission bands and analog filter edges, and then
flag outliers at 6$\sigma$ to remove RFI events.  Next, we suppress foreground
emission by applying a DDR filter to remove delays and delay-rates within the
horizon limit of a 300-m baseline (the maximum length of any PAPER baseline).
We derive a second set of RFI flags by masking 4$\sigma$ outliers in these
residuals and apply these flags back to the unfiltered data.  Finally, we
compress the data by applying a DDR filter preserving emission within the
horizon limit of a 300-m baseline, deconvolving to suppress flagging artifacts,
and down-sampling the result in time/frequency domain to the critical Nyquist
rate of the DDR filter.  The result is that the 2048 original frequency
channels become 203, and the 60 original time samples per 10-minute file become
14. 

% XXX merge with below
%Removed RFI by flagging samples in each frequency channel versus time that exceed the mean amplitude by 4-sigma
%after performing a time derivative.  Also flagged samples in each integrated spectrum that exceeded the
%mean amplitude across the spectrum by 6-sigma after performing a frequency derivative.  For efficiency, flagging
%was derived using only the subset of baselines involving a fiducial antenna.
%Frequencies below 120 MHz and above 180 MHz were also flagged, owing to roll-off of analog response.
%After RFI flagging, frequency channel resolution was decreased by a factor of four by summing channels.


%CALIBRATION
\subsection{Per-Antenna Gain and Phase Calibration}

% XXX differentiate amp cal here from spectral cal and absolute cal that comes later.

% XXX time-dependent calibration is critical.  modify paragraph below
Quantization gain through the correlator was linearized \citep{parsons_et_al2008}.
Measurements of ambient temperature versus time near the balun amplifier of a fiducial antenna and near
receiver amplifiers were used to divide out the predicted gain variation versus temperature that these amplifiers
are known to exhibit.  A predicted gain profile was drived using coefficients characterized in
laboratory measurements \citep{parashare_bradley2009} and
confirmed in field measurements \citep{pober_et_al2011} of $H_{\rm balun}=-0.024$ dB/K, $H_{\rm recvr}=-0.045$
dB/K, and $H_{\rm cable}=-0.018$ dB/K for 150m-long cables.  Because cable temperatures were not measured
during these observations, the cable temperature was assumed to be the same as the measured balun temperature.


Antenna delays and amplitudes were found by fitting a point source visibility
model to Centaurus A, Pictor A, and Fornax A.  Each source is imperfectly
modeled by a single point-source, but the solution differences are minimized by
averaging over the three independent solutions. These same calibration
solutions have been successfully applied in \citet{Pober:2013XXX} and \citet{Stefan:2013:XXX}.
for power-spectrum analysis of foregrounds and imaging of Centaurus A, respectively.

% XXX incorporate
To measure the spectrum of each source, we begin by applying per-antenna phase and gain
calibrations established via self-calibration.  We next remove
the known dependence of amplifier gain and cable attenuation on ambient temperature 
using measured temperature data and temperature coefficients that were characterized in
laboratory measurements \citep{parashare_bradley2009} and confirmed 
in field-measurements \citep{pober_et_al2012}.  For each source, we phase to the source 
osition
and sum over 
all baselines greater than 20 wavelengths in length.
A fringe-rate filter (see \citet{parsons_backer2009} and Appendix A in \citet{Parsons2013b})
is applied to the resulting
beam to suppress beam sidelobes where sources introduce variations that deviate more than 
$\pm$0.1 mHz from the fringe rate of the source in question.

%BEAMFORMING,FILTERING, AVERAGING

\subsection{Beamforming}

Spectral time-series are computed by beam-forming to the selected sky
locations. A beam is formed by phasing baselines to the desired location and
summing over baselines.  
%Samples were only included if there was a calibrator sample within 5\arcdeg in altitude/azimuth.   By using both seasons of data we were able to match all measurements with calibrator measurements, making this cut moot. 

% XXX incorporate paragraph below
%As the sky drifts through the primary beam of PAPER antennas, widely
%separated points will be observed with substantially different gains and
%so will require different data weightings to optimize SNR.
%Drift-scan observations of sources were divided by the calibrated beam response in the
%direction of the source as a function of time.  Spectra were calculated by averaging over
%time, weighting data at each time step by the square of the 150-MHz beam response in the source direction.
%Since noise and systematics relating to source observations are expected to be approximately constant
%versus time, while source amplitude is proportional to beam response, this weighting
%is an effective approximation of inverse-variance weighting \citep{pober_et_al2011}.

% XXX exclusion of minimum uv spacing?


 These complex spectra are then delay-delay rate filtered to remove spectrally
smooth sources far from phase center \citep{Parsons:2009p7859} (cf the LOFAR
de-mixing approach \cite{Offringa:2012p9691})  producing a time dependent
spectrum. This is then averaged in time,  weighting by a model of the primary
beam. This down-weighting, or multiplying by the primary beam, should be
clearly distinguished from up-weighting, which we are at pains to avoid.
Weighting by another factor of the primary beam is an effective approximation
of inverse-variance weighting \citep{Pober:2012p8800} and reduces the
contribution of noisy low elevation measurements.  The result is equivalent to
a very long earth rotation synthesis image with a single image pixel. When
combined with the filtering it is a robust and simple method for measuring
spectra of unresolved sources.

\subsubsection{Compensation for Resolution Effects in Pictor A}

% XXX unclear whether amplitudes include our model of Pic A, or are even actual data vs. weights
\end{figure}

The beam-forming method assumes the target is a point source. Our primary
target, Pictor A, is slightly resolved by PAPER, and merits closer attention.
Pictor A is a double-lobed radio galaxy with a main lobe separation of
7\arcmin. As we see in Figure \ref{fig:pic_perley}, it is nearly unresolved by
PAPER's 15\arcmin synthesized beam. However, given the high SNR of the
observations, resolution effects are observers, in a slight decrease in flux on
the longest ($\sim$300m) baselines. We account for this by weighting baselines
in the beam form step according to a model of structure observed by
\citet{Perley:1997p9312} at 330MHz, which they found to be consistent with
their more limited 74MHz images as well as the detailed high frequency maps.
The normalized image is Fourier transformed and sampled at the desired uv
spacing by spline interpolation. These samples are used to weight each baseline
contribution in the baseline sum. The result is an estimate of the total
integrated flux for Pictor A. Where the resolution is highest, at the top of
the band, the correction is 3\%. At the bottom of the band, where the
resolution size has grown to 19\arcmin, the correction is only 0.6\%. The
resulting spectrum is shown in Figure \ref{fig:pic_spectrum}a.

% XXX specific discussion of baseline weights to compensate for resolution effects for Pictor A
% XXX need to elaborate on correcting for resolution effects for PicA.
% XXX check paragraph below for relavant phrases
Because Pictor A is resolved at the 20\% level on the longest (300m) East-West PAPER baselines, we 
use per-baseline estimates of resolution weights to down-weight and correct for resolution effects.  To estimate
resolution weights, we use the 90cm map of Pictor A presented in \citet{perley_et_al1997}.  Averaged over all
the baselines in the array, the inclusion of resolution effects changed the measured flux by less than 5\%.

%BANDPASS CALIBRATION
\subsection{Bandpass Calibration}
\label{sec:Calibration}

% XXX selection of calibrator sources

The gain of each channel is the product of an overall instrumental passband and
the spectral dependence of the primary beam in the direction of the source.
Sources sharing the same track through the primary beam will have the same
average spectral gain function resulting from frequency dependent primary beam
attenuation.   We matched each measured source spectrum time sample to the
nearest sample (in altitude/azimuth) of a calibrator source
(J2331-416)\footnote{This source was chosen for the amount of data found in the
literature and the apparent smoothness of the spectrum.}.  We then, average the
% XXX clarify why one source used here, and more sources later 
two matched data streams in time.  Since both tracks make the same slice
through the primary beam, they will have the same average effective gain.
Assuming a power law model for J2331-416 (33Jy $\alpha=-0.76$), we compute a
% XXX I got these parameters for 2331: $S_{150}=31.9\ {\rm Jy}$, $\alpha=-0.69$ 
% XXX forward reference section on fitting spectra for how this was derived for 2331
bandpass gain.  After calibrating the raw 203 channel spectra with this
bandpass, we average into 10MHz sub-bands between 120 and 180 MHz, computing
the standard deviation as an estimate of the error. 

% XXX merge this with above
%To further improve these estimates, we derive an additional frequency-dependent gain parameter,
%smoothed on 10-MHz scales,
%that brings the spectrum of J2331-416 into closest agreement with a power-law spectrum of
%$S_{150}=31.9\ {\rm Jy}$, $\alpha=-0.69$ that represents the best fit to measurements below 1 GHz
%\citep{slee1995,kuhr_et_al1981,large_et_al1981,burgess_hunstead2006}.
%This additional gain factor was applied to all measured spectra, including that
%of Pictor A.  The expectation is that, since all sources at similar declinations follow similar tracks 
%through the PAPER beam, any errors present in the original measured spectra as a result of differences between
%the simulated and actual beam response should be absent in the ratio between source spectra, and therefore
%should be corrected by the applied gain factor


\subsection{Fitting a Power-Law Model to Spectra}

% XXX write this

To compare with observations at other frequencies we must assume a spectral
model. The prevailing spectral model for low frequency radio sources is a
single power law due to synchrotron emission, though curvature or other
deviation from a power-law is not-uncommon.   To establish a baseline model, we
fit a spectral model to prior catalog data from the spectrally and spatially
cross-matched meta-catalog by \citet{Vollmer:2010p6422} using the MCMC method
described in \S \ref{sec:flux_scale} and the Appendix. Confidence contours for
these fits are shown in grey in Figs. \ref{fig:SI_contour_1} -
\ref{fig:SI_contour_4}.  In general these are lower limits on the possible
precision, as the Vollmer catalog emphasizes minimization of cross-match error
but at the cost of excluding data points.  The fit is then performed again with
both PAPER and catalog data, shown in black on the same Figures. The values are
given in Table \ref{tab:fits}, and
illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:src_spec}.  

In this paper we estimate spectral model parameters and flux calibration in a
Bayesian way by calculating and marginalizing the posterior probability of the
data, past and present, given a spectral and instrumental model.   This method
offers improved repeatability by specifying a single objective function that
represents the quality of the model fit and naturally defines the errors on the
parameters \citep{Hogg:2010p8759}.   See  \citet{Mackay:2003p9717}  or
\citet{Sivia:2006p9736} for more on Bayesian analysis methods and an excellent
astrophysical example by \cite{Press:1997p9783}.

% XXX paragraph too remedial. digest
In general an experiment measures data $D$ and given some model of the
statistics of the measurement one usually assigns an error bar defining the
probability of getting that data, given a model $M$.  Given all the new data,
and prior data, there will be a new optimal set of model parameters $M$ with
associated error bars.  In general, these error bars are a parameterization of
a probability distribution function.  The pdf associated with the data often
called the likelihood ($\mathcal{L}$), while the one corresponding the model
error bars is the {\em posterior probability distribution}, $\Prob(M|D)$. They
are related

\[
\Prob(M|D) = \frac{\mathcal{L}(D|M) \Prob(M)}{\Prob(D)}
\] 
by the factor $\frac{\Prob(M)}{\Prob(D)}$, the prior probability of the model
$M$ (given past experiments) over the normalization factor, integrating over
all models.  In general the posterior pdf depends on both the known relation
between the model parameters and as well as correlations hidden within the
data.  

% XXX too remedial.  digest to 1 senetence
Direct calculation of the posterior is difficult, particularly the
normalization factor, however there is a simple procedure for drawing samples
from the posterior. In this paper we use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler.
Given any current location in parameter space, this algorithm draws a new set
of parameters and computes the relative likelihood increase. If the probability
difference is larger than a number drawn randomly from the set $(0:1]$, the
jump is accepted ---a Metropolis-Hastings step. In the limit of an infinity of
such steps, this process has been shown to converge on the true posterior
distribution.  In practice it is run for a large number of steps until things
appear to stabilize. The best fit model is the median of all the sampled
parameter sets, while the volume containing a well defined fraction of samples
sets the confidence limits.  The oft quoted ``1$\sigma$" probability level
corresponding to a gaussian distribution contains 65\% of the samples. In
practice the contours are not gaussian. Here we choose a slightly more
conservative probability level of 76\% 

We fit a spectral power law to catalog values by sampling
a (log) likelihood which assumes Gaussian measurement errors

\[
\logL = \sum_\nu{\frac{\left(S_\nu - S150\left(\frac{\nu}{150}\right)^\alpha\right)^2}{\Delta \textrm{SPAPER}_\nu}} \label{eq:catlogL}
\]

We estimate the confidence interval of the resulting parameters as the boundary
enclosing 76\% of the samples. In the catalog we report both the upper and
lower of these values for both parameters and plot the 2D contour to show the
correlation of the two parameters. Many of these contours, the grey curves in
Fig. \ref{fig:SI_contour_1}, are classic banana plots, displaying a non-linear
correlation between the parameters.    In most cases the single contour
adequately describes 2D posterior distribution.

\subsection{Approximating an Absolute Flux Scale}
\label{sec:flux_scale}

At this stage each source flux is tied to a model fit on the catalog values of
J2331-416. The accuracy of this fit and the implied uncertainty in the flux
scale limits the accuracy of the PAPER measurements..  To refine the flux
scale, we bootstrap a single global flux scale correction factor using 5
sources selected for their brightness, spectral linearity and data
availability\footnote{Calibration sources:
2250-412,2331-416,2140-434,0007-446,0704-427}. To build a more complete
spectral model we go beyond the data found in SPECFIND, using all spectral
measurements below 2GHz found in the NED database.  These catalog measurements
are primarily by Parkes, and Molonglo with the best precision coming from the
Wills fluxes at 538 and 634 MHz (when available). Where error bars are not
given, we assume uncertainty of 25\%. 

As described in the Appendix, we fit spectral index models for all sources
(using catalog data) simultaneously with a global PAPER flux scale factor
(using the PAPER data). We fit the model using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
sampler to sample the posterior probability of PAPER data ($SPAPER_{\nu}$) and
catalog values ($Scat_{\nu}$) given a spectral index model for each source and
a global flux scale factor ($g$) ($S_\PAPER^\textrm{calibrated} = g S_\PAPER$).
The resulting flux scale distribution function is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:gain}. The 76\% confidence limit on this flux scale, relative to the
J2331-413 calibration, is  $-0.01 ^{+0.11}_{-0.17}$ dB, or a 3.24\%
multiplicative error on every calibrated PAPER measurement.  


The calibrated spectra are plotted in Figures \ref{fig:srcs1},\ref{fig:srcs2},
\& \ref{fig:srcs3} and the data are listed in Table \ref{tab:data}.  See the
Appendix for details on this fitting procedure and definition of terms.  The
resulting Pictor A spectrum ranges in precision from 6.5\% at 125MHz to 4.7\%
at 185MHz. At least half of this error is due to uncertainty in the flux scale.  
%\footnote{Of the 315 data points in this catalog, 7 fluxes points are negative. All three occur quite close to Centaurus A, which has large structure on degree scales in this region and is the brightest sources in the sky. These sources have been flagged and removed from further analysis.}

%The Pictor track is calibrated to 2331-416 ($S_{150}=33.8$Jy,$\alpha=-0.76$) and the Hydra A track to 0231-126 ($S_{150}=21$Jy,$\alpha=-0.7$).  
%    cal['0213-132'] = 21 * (fq/.150)**-0.7  
%    cal['1932-464'] = 93.7 * (fq/.150)**-0.82 
%    #cal['2331-416'] = 31.9 * (fq/.150)**-0.69
%    cal['2331-416'] = 33.9 * (fq/.150)**-0.76
%COMPARISON WITH DATA

% XXX connect with text above
A single overall flux scale is computed in a similar way. However, here we add
a single extra gain factor $g$ multiplying all PAPER measurements, and sum over
several sources.

\begin{align}
\log\mathcal{L}_s &= \sum_{\nu}\frac{ (S_\textrm{cat}^{\nu}  - S_{150}  \left(\frac{\nu}{150}\right)^\alpha)^2}{2(\Delta S_\textrm{cat}^\nu)^2} +
\frac{ (g*S_\PAPER^{\nu}  - S_{150}\left(\frac{\nu}{150}\right)^\alpha)^2}{2(\Delta S_\PAPER^\nu)^2}\\
\log\mathcal{L} &= \sum_{s} \log\mathcal{L}_s
\end{align}
Another nice feature of the MCMC sampler is that each parameter sample is fully
covariant with the others. To marginalize over the fitted flux and spectral
index parameters and compute confidence limits on the gain parameter, we simply
ignore them.


\section{Results and Discussion}
\label{sec:fits}

%0008-421#
%1243-412#
%1247-401#
%1315-460
%TODO round up the source counts

In the 59 sources measured, four demonstrated poor convergence fitting a single
spectral index to both the PAPER data and prior catalog data. In three
cases\footnote{1243-412,1247-401,1315-460} %TODO update these sources are in
the Centaurus A/galactic plane region. Though the beam forming method provides
relatively high dynamic range of $\sim$100:1 it is unable to distinguish
between these sources and the bright diffuse Centaurus and galactic structure.
The last source, 0008-421, was not detected by previous PAPER observations and
exhibits flattening at higher frequencies, most likely due to synchrotron
self-absorption \citep{Jacobs:2011p8438} .  The remaining 94\% MCMC chains
arrived at a stable posterior distribution. The spectral index parameters for
these chains are given in table \ref{tab:fits}.

Inspecting the confidence contours we find that, for the vast majority ($\sim
75$\%), the PAPER measurements confirm the power law extrapolation from higher
frequencies. The remaining 25\% either A) have large PAPER error bars and
therefore provide no new information or B) do not agree with the spectral index
model.  To understand where most measurements fall on this spectrum we
numerically quantify the overall model improvement derived from the addition of
the PAPER data as 
\begin{align}
\textrm{Improvement} &= \left(\textrm{Precision increase}\right) \left(\textrm{Catalog agreement}\right)\\
&= \left(\frac{1}{Area(\textrm{PAPER})} - \frac{1}{Area(\textrm{Cat})}\right) \left( Area(\PAPER \cap \textrm{Cat}) \right)
\end{align}
% XXX This equation is yucky

We quantify the fit {\em precision increase} as the change in the contour
figure of merit, defined as the inverse area of the confidence contour.
Meanwhile, {\em catalog agreement} is the fraction of the PAPER confidence
interval that overlaps the catalog confidence interval.  Thus, for example, in
a PAPER fit that overlaps the catalog confidence contour by 41\% but increases
in precision (confidence area shrinks) by a factor of 3, the resulting {\em
improvement} will be 0.123.  

In these sources, the improvement index ranges from a max of 6.9 to -0.022.
10\% of sources showed negative improvement, suggesting that PAPER data have
added to uncertainty (see Figure \ref{fig:SI_contour_bad}). 12\% of sources
have exactly zero improvement, which indicates that the PAPER data have pulled
the fit far from the model preferred by the catalog data (see Fig.
\ref{fig:SI_contour_new}).  The spectral models of these sources have not been
included in Table \ref{tab:fits}.  The remainder of the spectral fits are
included for completeness, but given the range of quality found, particularly
near the Galactic plane and Centaurus A, should be used with utmost caution.

However, the majority of source 78\% have positive improvement index,
indicating strong confirmation of the extrapolated spectrum (see Figures
\ref{fig:SI_contour_1} - \ref{fig:SI_contour_4}).  Pictor A is in the middle of
this group  with an improvement of 0.39 ---only 14 sources show stronger
confirmation.  The flux model is $S150=$388 $\pm$ 9.4Jy, $\alpha=-0.77\pm0.02$.
% XXX need more detail here.  This is the crux of what is done.
The combination of several independent PAPER data points near 150MHz with
previous catalog measurements results in this estimated uncertainty of 2.4\%.
This uncertainty is dominated by agreement between the 2 Wills measurements
near 600MHz which are accurate to 2\% and the five PAPER measurements, which
are accurate to ~5\%.

 \section{Conclusion}
 \label{sec:Conclusion}

% XXX adapt this paragraph to be a summary of the broad goals attained in this paper
The primary purpose of this observation is to produce a high quality Pictor A
% XXX need to coordinate "primary purpose" here with abstract and intro motivation
spectrum. As a verification measure we have observed many other sources at the
same declination for comparison against previous observations.  Our comparison
metric will be the degree to which the PAPER data are consistent with previous
observations,given a model and, if consistent, they improve on the precision of
our spectral model parameters.
 
Direct measurements of the Pictor A spectrum are key to correctly setting the
flux scale of PAPER and other EoR experiments. Existing EoR band measurements
are accurate to 20\% implying a 40\% uncertainty in the absolute power spectrum
level.  Here we have provided new measurements of Pictor A that are accurate to
2.4\%;  388 $\pm$ 9.4Jy on the \citet{Baars:1977p9678} scale. The PAPER
measurement has a precision of $<$1\%; the majority of the uncertainty comes in
setting the absolute flux scale from prior data.  

We also take advantage of multiple PAPER observations to measure the next  61
brightest, previously cataloged, sources. These sources are distributed over
the full 24 hours of Right Ascension coverage but are within 5 degrees
declination of Pictor A.  Using a Bayesian analysis we conclude that most of
these are consistent with previous measurements and provide useful new
constraints. However, in the remainder, the simple spectral model fails to
adequately describe the data. In most cases the proximity to bright or extended
structures implies side lobe contamination.  Therefore, though we include the
model parameters, they are not meant to be definitive, but provide confidence
that the reported PAPER flux values are on the correct global scale.

The data  include new measurements of Pictor A that are uncertain to 3.5\%,
close to the level of the most precise higher frequency measurements by
\citet{Wills:1975p9314}. Using these new measurements we update the spectral
calibration model to an accuracy of 2.5\%. As validation of this method, we
also measure a selection of 58 additional sources at the same Declination.

These sources offer results at odds with previous measurements. These have
small enough error bars to require a deviation from spectral index fit
suggested by prior catalog measurements. All are near Centaurus A (see Figure
\ref{fig:error_map}), a very bright, extended source, and are likely evidence
for side lobe contamination.  Side lobes from distant sources manifest as
ripples in the spectrum, increasing the error bars (e.g. the sources listed in
Figure \ref{fig:SI_contour_bad}). However, the sources shown here are close
enough to Centaurus A that the side-lobe oscillates on scales longer than 10MHz
and does not fall into the rms, but rather into the mean. Thus these few points
have anomalously high fluxes and small error bars.
